When this build pattern is used : 

lets there are fields in the class , some of them are optional, when ever the constructor is creating, we have some optional which is of our choice,
 use or not, and also compilation error occus whem we have same constructor with same numbers of arguments when we use required field 


Buidler pattren is to build step by step and  finally build the object ;

lets take an example constructing the house;

first step is add roof, 
next step is add walls,
next step is doors,
next step is interior

finally build 




Example : 


stringBuilder -> gives always a stringBuilder method -> after completion of all opertaions when ever we use toSting it gives actual string object
